# Galaxy Project

This folder contains prototypes and files related to the **Galaxy Workflow Engine**.

The goal of this section is to define and run simple workflows to demonstrate Galaxy's capabilities in managing and reproducing scientific processes.

## Quick Start
To run a sample workflow:
1. Prepare a workflow file (e.g. `workflow.xml`).
2. Run Galaxy and load the workflow.

## Folder Structure
- `workflow.xml`: A prototype of a simple workflow
- Other tools and supporting files will be added in the future

## Description
Galaxy is a powerful platform for performing scientific and data analytics. In this project, we use it to create reproducible and auditable workflows.
